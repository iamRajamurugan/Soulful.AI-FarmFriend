Place your TensorFlow models here:

- `crop_disease_model.h5` - Model for crop disease prediction
- `fertilizer_recommendation_model.h5` - Model for fertilizer recommendations (optional)

These files are not included in the repository due to their size. You'll need to train or download them separately.
